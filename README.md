## Description
This project focused on data mining, data preprocessing and cleaning, and data transferring in SQL using Microsoft SQL Server and SSIS, along with data visualization in Tableau. The goal is to analyze and visualize food access data from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas dataset. The project includes creating visualizations for the top states with low access tracts, a geographical map of food access, and a breakdown of food access by ethnicity. From these visualzations, the following conclusons were made:
 1. Wymoing, South Dakota, and Mississipi have the worst food accessibility
 2. The South and Midwest suffer from the most food deserts
 3. Maine and D.C. improved their food availablity from 2015-2019, while Alaska and Mississippi regressed
 4. Blacks suffer from low food accessiblity the most across all ethinc groups

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the USDA Food Access Research Atlas dataset, which provides comprehensive data on food access indicators for different geographic areas in the United States. The dataset can be accessed at the following link: [USDA Food Access Research Atlas Dataset](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/)

## Tools and Skills
To replicate and explore this project, the following tools and skills are required:
- SQL Server: To perform data mining and analysis tasks using SQL queries.
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): To extract, transform, and load the data from the USDA dataset into the SQL Server database.
- Tableau: To create data visualizations and interactive dashboards based on the SQL Server data.

## Results
This project provides insights into food access disparities using data mining techniques in SQL and visualizations in Tableau. The following key results were achieved:
1. Top States with Low Access Tracts: Visualized the states with the highest number of low access tracts using bar charts, providing a comparative analysis.
2. Geographical Map of Food Access: Created an interactive map in Tableau to visualize food access indicators across different geographic areas, highlighting areas with limited access.
3. Breakdown of Food Access by Ethnicity: Developed visualizations that illustrate the distribution of food access indicators by ethnicity, allowing for a deeper understanding of disparities.
4. Highlighted trends in food accessiblity: Identified which states improved or regressed in their food accessiblity across the 2015 and 2019 dataset.

The project's code and visualizations can be found in the respective folders of this GitHub repository

Feel free to explore the project and adapt it to further analyze the USDA Food Access Research Atlas dataset or apply similar techniques to other datasets of interest.
