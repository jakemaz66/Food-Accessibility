# Food-Accessibility
A data visualization project highlighting some key insights about food availability from the Food Access Research Atlas. The datasets used in the analysis can be found at this link: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/.

The project began with basic data cleaning procedures, and importing the necessary files to SQL Server Studio for filtering and querying. After the files were imported and filtered, a series of queries were performed to gain insight into the data. The goal of this project was to gain insights to guide a hypothetical 'Resource Allocation Committee' in investing in areas with low food availability. These areas, where supermarkets are located at significant distances away from residences, are also known as food deserts. 

After several queries yielded insights, these queries were connected to Tableau where the data visualization dashboard was built. Several insights were garnered such as geographical and ethnic need, as well as trends in improving or declining availability.
